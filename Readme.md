Readme
This is a website with a slideshow, a video, and a chatbot.

Slideshow:
The slideshow uses JavaScript to animate between five  images. The current slide is controlled by the currentSlide variable. The changeSlide() function is used to move to the next or previous slide.


Chatbot:
The chatbot is embedded using the Chatbase.co. The window.embeddedChatbotConfig object is used to configure the chatbot.

Usage:
To use this code, simply copy and paste it into an HTML file and save it. Then, open the file in a web browser to view the website.

Customization
You can customize the website by changing the images in the slideshow, the video, and the chatbot configuration. You can also add additional CSS and JavaScript to customize the look and feel of the website.

Notes
The Chatbase SDK must be included in the HTML file before the script element that embeds the chatbot.
